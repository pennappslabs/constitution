### September 9, 2012 Changes
- Generalized cost-breakdown, since last year we cut our budget to $7,500. No sense having the $10K
  figure enshrined in the Constitution when this will undoubtedly change year-to-year.
- Changed project generation process to remove Open House and add language for a more general,
  wider-spread and higher-impact discussion.
- Removed one project/semester language.
- Removed language of PennApps Labs advisory board, which hasn’t existed since I’ve been around.
- Added structural changes:
- Replaced pronged Tech+Operations lead with generalized Director(s) role.
- Added optional roles for community/marketing and tech evangelism.
- Added Project Lead role as leadership role within fulltime developers
- Clarified accountability — was confusing and slightly out of date, removed references to
  fictional advisory board.
- Remove "the board meets within one month of the open house to consider the proposal" (this
  provides more flexibility)
- Change PAL Board description to "Comprised of key stakeholders and funding partners, it will meet
  every semester to receive a progress report and approve ongoing and future PAL activities"
  (removes early semester and broadens scope)
- Remove "Technical and Operations Leads" from non-voting members of PAL Board
- Add section to PAL Board indicating voting can be done online/email
- Make clear PAL technology can not be used for profit (the University owns the tech, but they
  cannot sell it)
- Remove "during their semesterly meetings" from the Project Oversight section
- Clarified PayRoll center as OSA
