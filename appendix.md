UA Letter to Provost’s Office
=====

_Approved (2/13/11)_

Dear Provost Price and Staff,

This year has been no exception from years past in your steadfast support of our initiatives.  We greatly appreciate your continued time, consideration, and support of our policy recommendations.

For reasons articulated by both the Office of the Provost and the Undergraduate Assembly, we jointly decided to suspend the New York Times Readership Program this past year. However, as we begin our UA budget process, we are preparing to continue our support for PennApps Labs, a student agency that literally shapes student life at Penn by creating and maintaining student body-wide, student-run technologies. We are pleased to have the opportunity to submit this request for a New York Times Readership Program-like match of $10,000 from your office for PennApps Labs. We feel that PennApps Labs deserves this funding because it contributes to student life in three vital ways—continuity, innovation, and partnership.

First, PennApps Labs provides continuity of important student-generated technologies. Student groups who create meaningful innovations—like Penn Course Review—find difficulty in maintaining their services when developers complete their undergraduate programs. PennApps Labs promises to be an institution that creates sustainability in programs like PCR. By transferring knowledge year-to-year from project managers to developers, PennApps Labs creates the continuity necessary to relieve student groups of this burden.

Second, PennApps Labs is a hub of innovation that creates new student body-wide technologies. In building the app Study Spaces at Penn, the group has already demonstrated a great capacity for challenging and developing Penn students' creative and technical abilities for the good of the wider student body. The technology space in student life and academics is constantly evolving, and students are rapidly demanding new resources for their needs. PennApps Labs is in perfect position to garner opinion from their board of directors, comprised of UA and SCUE members, to develop newly demanded technologies.

Third and finally, PennApps Labs is equipped to readily partner with both student groups and important University centers. Weiss Tech House continues to be an engine of innovation to a growing undergraduate population.  Public and explicit support of PennApps Labs will bring Weiss Tech House, along with other technology-based centers and programs at Penn, to the forefront. The capacity for these centers to mentor undergraduates with an affinity for technological creativity is unlimited, all while the product goes to benefit students as a whole. PennApps is a great step toward uniting the campus through common needs and an incredible opportunity.

Sincerely,

The Undergraduate Assembly
